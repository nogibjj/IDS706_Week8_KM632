## Week 8 Comparing Python to Rust

This project compares the Python and Rust image processing capabilities. 

Both programs takes an image as input and resize and blur the image. It then saves the image as an output. 

Python uses Pillow library whereas Rust uses Image library. 

Devcontianer is created with Rust as the base image. It then installs Python3 as extensions and its dependent libraries.
